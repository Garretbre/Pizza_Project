# Pizza_Project

In the HTML and CSS course I was assigned to create a pizza ordering site. Based on the users selection 
of pizza size, vegetables and meat options. The customer would be given a price of their order of pizza.

This was a project during the first few months of my schooling at The Tech Academy.
